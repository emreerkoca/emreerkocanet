I'm Emre Erkoca. I have CS degree but I don' t feel like a software engineer. I have to learn Software Architecture. I want to know how to make a big project from scratch. When a lot of user come to inside, I want to ensure make it live. I'm trying convince myself to work side projects. I' ll try write original articles. It' s my [GitHub](https://github.com/emreerkoca) account and this is [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emre-erkoca-a7a51987/)

Regards
